                        +--------------------+

The questions in this design document should reflect the design of the code you
wrote for the project.  Your grade will reflect both the quality of your answer
in this document and the quality of the design implementation in your code.  You
may receive partial credit for answering questions for parts of the project that
you did not get to implement, but you must indicate in your answer that there is
no corresponding implementation, or you will not receive any credit.

For each question, you should include both the name of the file(s), function
name(s), and the line numbers where the relevant code may be found---both the
code that answers the question directly and any function that you refer to in
your answer.

These design documents will be completed and submitted as a group.  Please use
this document as a guide for design and discuss the questions and their
potential answers prior to beginning implementation.

When you have completed your design document, submit it to the Canvas assignment
Project 0 Design and Documentation.

***Your submission must be a text file and each line must not extend pat 80
characters.  In addition, your submission must contain all of the original
material and not exceed 8,000 characters.  The character count will be measured
using the Linux command wc.  (Note that rtf files are NOT text files.)

Preliminaries
##############
(1) If you have any preliminary comments on your submission or notes for
    the TA, please give them here.  If you did not implement all portions
    of this project, that should be noted here.

(2) Please cite any offline or online sources you consulted while
    preparing your submission, other than the Linux documentation,
    course text, and lecture notes.

Questions regarding Part 0
##############
(1) How many child processes are created when doFib() 
    begins with an input of 5?  Show the return value for 
    each child process, numbering the processes beginning 
    with 0 (the original process) and incrementing for
    each child process.
    
    -fib.c   
    -doFib()
    -53-90

    Creates 14 child processes(shown in level order traversal)
    0: 5
	1a: 3  1b: 2  
    2a: 2  2b: 1  2c: 1  2d: 1
    3a: 1  3b: 1  3c: 1  3d: 0  3e: 1  3f: 0
    4a: 1  4b: 0

(2) Explain how you communicated the return value of the 
    child to the parent. What feature of wait() did you use?
    
    -fib.c
    -doFib()
    -53-90

	 waitpid() to wait for child processes to finish 1st. Then, WEXITSTATUS 
     to get exit code of child & store it to pass return val to parent. 

##############
Questions regarding Part 1
##############
(1) In the provided utility function Signal(), what does the call to
  sigaction() do?  Why was sigaction() used instead of signal()?
    
    -sigutil.c
    -signal_action(), sigaction()
    -18-33
    
    sigaction() changes the set action of a process and redirects to the signal
    handler depending on what it receives. sigaction() used as its more 
    reliable (portable), more control over signal handling - can signal mask & 
    add flags.

##############
Questions regarding Part 2
##############
(1) What combination of structs, arrays, and other data structures 
    did you use to represent a fully-parsed command? Pick another 
    (reasonable) representation you could have used, and give one advantage 
    and one disadvantage of the representation you chose.

    Note that you do not need to include concurrent commands in your answer. 
    Part 2 does not include this advanced shell feature.

    -utcsh.c
    -parse_command(), get_num_toks(), tokenize_command_line()
    -34-39, 339-343, 305-313, 222-261
    
    Used struct Command. args member is a tokenized string array storing the 
    command and its args, outputFile points to tgt file (string) for output 
    redirection, num_tokens (get_num_toks()) stores # of tokens 
    in command, & num_redirects (get_num_redirects()) stores # of 
    redirect symbols in command. tokenize_command_line() delimits input string 
    using whitespace and stores in char** array. 
    
    Advantage: adaptable & more members can be added to the struct to store more
    information about the command. 
    Disadvantage: array of fixed size to store command args, limiting how many 
    args a command can have. 

    Could use linked list of tokens. Head of list would be member in Command 
    struct, & linked list struct would have each node representing a token, 
    with value of the token held in a char ptr. The struct would contain 
    another struct, a ptr to next token in list to access each individual 
    token. 


(2) An invalid script file is one which does not contain anything (i.e. 
    a size zero file). How did you detect and handle this condition?  
    Describe one other (correct) design that you could have used.

    -utcsh.c
    -fgets(), get_num_toks(), parse_command(), fgets()
    -86-109, 305-313, 339-343

    Done through bool var & fgets(). Set bool to true, then run fgets() in 
    while loop to read input from file. If fgets() true & can read input, 
    tokenize the line of input, parse through it, & count # tokens. If # 
    tokens is > 0, script_empty set false. Else, if bool still true, throw 
    error & exit. Could use stat() & st_size field to determine file size. 
    If st_size 0, file is empty & throw error. 


##############
Questions regarding Part 3
##############
(1) Describe how your implementation ensures that concurrent
    commands are executed concurrently instead of one after 
    another.

    -utcsh.c
    -main(), tokenize_command_line_for_concurrency(), tokenize_command_line(), 
    exec_external_command(), eval()
    -96-118, 265-301, 222-261, 430-582, 363-369

    In main, store commands delimited by "&" 
    using tokenize_command_line_for_concurrency() in a String array. Loop 
    through each cmd & tokenize again using tokenize_command_line(), then call 
    eval() on cmd currently being processed. To concurrently execute external 
    cmds, in exec_external_cmd(), 1st fork the child, call execv(). In main() 
    after for loop calling eval on each cmd is over, run another for loop 
    calling wait() on all the above processes, executing them when they have 
    all finished being run -> executing concurrently.

(2) One potential strategy for redirecting output is to run 
    the following code:

  ```
  FILE* output = fopen(filename, "w");
  stdout = output;
  stderr = output;
  ```

  This causes everything that would normally be written to 
  `stdout` to instead be written to the file described by 
  filename. Unfortunately, this strategy does not work for 
  output redirection in utcsh. More generally, it does not
  work any time fork-and-exec is used and we want to 
  redirect the output of the child process.

  Explain why this technique does not work when used in 
  conjunction with fork-and-exec, and why the dup2() 
  technique does not suffer the same issue.

    -utcsh.c
    -exec_external_command()
    -430-516

    When fork() makes new process -> gets file descriptors from parent. 
    File descriptors are distinct for each process, so when stdout and stderr 
    altered in child, doesn’t affect parent or concurrent processes -> won’t 
    be written to specified file. dup2() works with output redirection as it 
    duplicates file descriptor for output file onto stdout & stderr - matches 
    for child & output file.
