Project 1: Threads
Introduction
Welcome to Project 1: Threads! This assignment aims to extend the functionality of a minimally functional thread system provided to gain a better understanding of synchronization problems. You'll be working primarily in the threads directory, with some work in the devices directory.

Alarm Clock
Reimplement timer_sleep() to avoid busy waiting and improve efficiency.

Priority Scheduling
Implement priority scheduling where threads with higher priority preempt lower-priority threads.

Priority Donation
Implement priority donation to prevent priority inversion and ensure fairness in thread scheduling.
